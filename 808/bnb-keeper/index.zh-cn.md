<p>The BNB Keeper is a decentralized application built on the Binance Smart Chain. The object of the game is to hire more Bees sooner and more often than other Bee Keepers. This in turn earns you more BNB faster. These busy Bees work for you tirelessly, giving you a daily average of 8% of your Bee's value. The daily percentage return depends on the actions that are taken within the platform that impact the Bee's efficiency rate. The farming efficiency rate rises and falls as users buy Bees, Pollinate your earnings and sell your Honey for BNB. Once Bees are Bought, they cannot be sold, and the investment made to Pollinate them (either through Hire or Pollinating) cannot be taken back. However, once bought, Bees will not stop producing Honey!</p>
