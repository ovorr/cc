<p>BNB Makers is a decentralized game built on the Binance Smart Chain. The object of the game is to hire more miners sooner and more often than other players. This in turn earns you more BNB faster. These miners work for you tirelessly, paying you an average of 4% daily on your initial BNB investment. The daily percentage return depends on users' actions that are taken within the platform that impact the miner's efficiency rate. The mining efficiency rate rises and falls as users hire miners, compound earnings and pocket BNB rewards. Once miners are hired, they cannot be sold, and the investment made to purchase them (either through depositing or compounding) cannot be taken back. However, once bought, miners will not stop producing yield.</p>
<p>Lottery</p>
<p>For every 0.005 BNB you deposit or compound, you will automatically be given 1 ticket to the current lottery, up to 50 tickets max. These tickets come at no additional cost to you and have no impact on your overall investment. The lottery is automatically drawn every 4 hours or when the lottery has 100 particpants, whichever comes first. When the winner is selected, 90% of the lottery pot is sent to the winner's available rewards balance as a bonus.</p>
