<p>BNB Yield Mining is for users who want long term profits and sustainability. It is not for people who want instant profits that ultimately cause loss for other users.</p>
<p>Yield Mining is not to be confused with Yield Farming. Miners are not bought, they are hired and therefore cannot be sold. Once minters are hired they work for you forever, providing earnings every day at a modest starting rate of 3%.</p>
<p>Our algorithm allows every user to profit handsomely, no matter their Mining Strategy.</p>
